# workspaces-tab-counter

This extension adds fine tab counting functionality to Opera GX. It also themes itself according to your GX theme :) (currently only dark)

You can now see how many tabs there are per workspace in a simple table, both as a sidebar panel and an extension popup, wherever you prefer.
